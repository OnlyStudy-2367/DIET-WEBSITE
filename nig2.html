    <pre>Popular Diet Plans
    There are different types of diet plans designed to meet various health and fitness goals. Below are some of the most well-known diet plans:
    
    <strong>Mediterranean Diet</strong>
    This diet is inspired by the traditional eating habits of countries like Greece and Italy. It includes:
    
    - Fresh fruits and vegetables
    - Whole grains and legumes
    - Healthy fats like olive oil and nuts
    - Lean proteins like fish and poultry
    
    The Mediterranean diet is known to promote heart health, reduce inflammation, and support brain function.
    
    <strong>Ketogenic (Keto) Diet</strong>
    A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that encourages the body to enter ketosis, a state where fat is burned for energy instead of carbohydrates. Key components include:
    
    - Healthy fats (avocados, nuts, olive oil)
    - Moderate protein (chicken, fish, eggs)
    - Very low carbohydrates (no sugar, grains, or starchy vegetables)
    
    The Keto diet is commonly used for weight loss and managing blood sugar levels.
    
    <strong>Vegetarian Diet</strong>
    A diet that eliminates meat while still allowing plant-based proteins such as lentils, beans, tofu, and dairy products. Variations include:
    
    - Lacto-vegetarian (includes dairy but no eggs)
    - Ovo-vegetarian (includes eggs but no dairy)
    - Vegan (excludes all animal products)
    
    This diet supports heart health and is rich in fiber, antioxidants, and essential nutrients.
    
    <strong>Intermittent Fasting (IF)</strong>
    Rather than focusing on what to eat, intermittent fasting emphasizes when to eat. Common IF methods include:
    
    - 16/8 Method – Fasting for 16 hours and eating within an 8-hour window
    - 5:2 Method – Eating normally for five days and reducing calorie intake for two days
    - One Meal a Day (OMAD) – Eating all daily calories in a single meal
    
    IF helps regulate metabolism, improve insulin sensitivity, and promote fat loss.
